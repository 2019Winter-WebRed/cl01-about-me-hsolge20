        <h1>About My Family</h1>
        <hr />
        <!-- This paragraph is about my family members -->
            <p> My name is Hannah Solge I am 16 years old and I am a Junior at <b>Padua</b>. I was born on May 22, 2002, in Wilmington, DE to my mom Michele and my dad Gene. I  have an older sister named Meghan and she is 21 years old. I have a dog named Dewey, he is a goldendoodle and he is 5 years old. I used to have a dalmation named Sebastion, he was very energetic and would jump down the stairs without touching any of them. My favorite book growing up was <i>The Giving Tree</i> written by Shel Silverstein.</p>
        
        <h1>What I Like To Do</h1>
        <!-- This paragraph is about what I like to do in my free time -->
            <p>In my free time, I like to play sports like softball and track. I play softball all around the country infront of different college coaches. Some places I have been to include Colorado, Florida, and Georigia. I have been playing softball since I was 5 years old and hope to continue to play in college. I have many different colleges that I would like to go to such as Shippensburg University, University of North Florida, and Barry Univeristy.</p><blockquote>"Play like a champion today."</blockquote>

        <h1>What I Want To Be</h1>
        <!-- This paragraph is about what I would like to do as a job when I get older -->
            <p>In college I want to study Athletic training because I want to work with injured athletes. I want to do this as a job because I like to watch and play sports and this would keep me in the sports community. One of my goals is to become the head athletic trainor for a professional sports team because not many women have that opportunity. This would inspire young girls to believe they can have any job they want even if it is currently taken by a man.</p>
